# ðŸ“¨ cold-email-generator

A smart cold email generator for services companies, built using **GROQ**, **LangChain**, and **Streamlit**. This tool allows users to input a companyâ€™s careers page URL, extract job listings from it, and generate personalized cold outreach emails with relevant portfolio links â€” all tailored to each job description.

## How It Works

1. **Input:** Careers page URL (e.g., Nikeâ€™s job listing page)
2. **Processing:** Extracts job descriptions using LLM
3. **Vector Search:** Finds relevant portfolio links from a ChromaDB vector store
4. **Generation:** Crafts a personalized cold email using GROQ and LangChain
5. **Output:** A compelling outreach email with links to similar work

2. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
    ```commandline
     pip install -r requirements.txt
